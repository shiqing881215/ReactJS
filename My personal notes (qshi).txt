My personal notes (qshi) :

This is the tutorial I follow tightly with 
https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html
to learn React.js

Some notes : 
1. Need to run a simple server to finish this tutorial, download everthing from 
   https://github.com/reactjs/react-tutorial
   Then in root directory of this repo, run "node server.js"
   it will load the index.html under /public by default on port 3000
2. index.html is the only file you need to touch
3. Right now, since react-tutorial is also a git repo which is coming from the above fa   react offical link, so I just copy the index.html to this top directory. For all the   related detail info, please follow the office git hub link in (1)
